        "descrMain": "While working at Yandex in the Avto.ru team, I made a great contribution to the product development. My big product task was to create a new block with reviews from scratch, which I placed on all the main pages. Among other things, I redesigned the functionality of the outdated \"Reset filters\" block in the listing. I also integrated a platform for collecting feedback and participated in updating blocks with content on the main pages (reviews, the \"Tests and overviews\" block, product cards with an updated design, etc.).",
        "descrSub": "In addition to the above, I was engaged in optimization activities, including moving to new endpoints, fixing both minor and critical bugs, refactoring the code and writing unit tests, both standard and screenshot ones."

        "descrMain": "Data & Finance Technologies is a financial application that can analyze real financial data. The application offers a set of flexible tools for interacting with data, formatting it, changing it, as well as for generating detailed reports in tabular and graphical forms.",
        "descrSub": "While working on this project, I was the only front-end developer and had full responsibility for the entire front-end component of the application. I supported a multi-page admin panel integrated with the backend, and also wrote new pages from scratch. In addition, I also wrote complex and multifunctional components with financial business logic based on components from third-party libraries (Material UI, Prime React, and Ant Design). I also refactored previously written code and restructured it."

        "title": "Minesweeper",
        "subtitle": "\"Minesweeper\" Game",
        "descrMain": "This application is a copy of the iconic \"Minesweeper\", which I developed in 3 days on React using NextJS.",
        "descrSub": "The game consists of a 16x16 field and follows the classic rules: the left mouse button opens a cell, the right mouse button marks the cell with a flag. The game, according to all the canons, also has a counter of remaining mines and a timer. Victory occurs if the player successfully opens all the cells without bombs, marking the rest with flags. Well, if you are blown up by a mine, you can always start the game over."

        "title": "English Puzzle",
        "subtitle": "\"English Puzzle\" Game",
        "descrMain": "This game is a simplified version of Duolingo. The main goal of the application is to improve English in an interactive game form.",
        "descrSub": "The game has six difficulty levels, each of which contains from 20 to 40 rounds. In each round, you have to collect logical sentences from randomly scattered words (Drag'n'Drop supported), and each word is a puzzle. Having collected ten sentences, you gain access to one of the iconic works of art. Depending on your level of English, you can use one of three hints, as well as skip a sentence. At the end of the round, you will see detailed statistics."

        "descrMain": "This game is my intermediate final project at one of the stages of training at RS School. It is an improved version of the popular Japanese puzzle.",
        "descrSub": "The application includes three difficulty levels, which differ in the size of the field and the complexity of the picture, but you can also choose a level randomly. You will not only have to solve Japanese crosswords, but also compete with yourself or with friends for a while, and the main feature of this application is a small trophy system straight from PlayStation. Can you unlock them all?"

        "descrSub": "The website was originally written in vanilla JavaScript, but after successfully completing RS School, I completely rewrote it using a more technological stack and Server-Side Rendering (Next.js). The site's design was inspired by the Deus Ex universe, and the background animation was generated by AI."
